At this the whole amount of Funds on the Account shall remain available for the purposes of participation in Transactions on the Platform and only the amount of Funds on the User’s Account net of the double-sized amount of Cryptocurrency being transferred shall be available for Withdrawals of Funds.</p>
	  <p>GlobeEx is entitled to set and vary maximum and minimum limits for Deposits and Withdrawals of Funds at its own discretion. GlobeEx shall not be liable for any preliminary notifications to the Users as regards such changes. At this </p>
	    <ul>
        <li>(i)	if the Account is Deposited in the amount that is less than allowed minimum for deposits, Funds shall not be credited to the User’s Account on the Platform, as well as shall not be transferred back to the User; </li>	
        <li>(ii)	deposits which are below the required minimums shall not be summed up.</li>	
      </ul>
	  <h5>4.3. Withdrawing Funds from Your Account</h5>
	  <p>To Withdraw Funds from your Account, you have to fill the corresponding form in your Personal Cabinet. You will get a message to the email address indicated during the registration process asking to confirm or to deny the Withdrawal operation. In case you deny or do not confirm the Withdrawal, the Funds will remain in the Account.</p>
	  <p>The Platform sets some restrictions for Funds withdrawals and you may not instigate withdrawal of Funds earlier than in three (3) days after changing User Account Data, which includes changing or restoring password, as well as changing authorization method. In case of depositing the Account with the use of some depositing methods, the Platform or a financial institution (EMI, payment service provider, bank etc.) may restrict any Withdrawal of Funds earlier than in three (3) days from the date of deposit.</p>
	  <p>Any confirmed Withdrawal is irrevocable and, therefore, may not be revoked.</p>
	  <h5>4.4. Suspicious Activity</h5>
	  <p>If you discover suspicious activity or operations, including but not limited to unknown Deposits and Withdrawals of Funds, made to/from your Account that were not initiated by you, you will immediately notify GlobeEx about such activities and/or operations and will follow the instructions sent by GlobeEx. Otherwise, GlobeEx reserves the right to freeze the Account until the end of investigation.</p>
	  <p>GlobeEx may also be forced to cancel or recall already executed Withdrawal at a request of financial institutions, which are involved in settlements related to Deposit and Withdrawal of Funds from the Users’ Accounts. In such cases you are obliged to cooperate with GlobeEx in order to discover the reasons for such request.</p>
	  <h5>4.5. Use of Chat</h5>
	  <p>The User gets access to the Chat after depositing the Account with the sum equal to or exceeding 200.00 (two hundred) USD or equivalent amount in other Fiat money or Cryptocurrency. While using the Chat, the User is prohibited to:</p>
	  <ul>
        <li>insult and threaten other Users and/or GlobeEx staff; this is considered as a direct violation of the rules of chat use and may result in a permanent ban of the User;</li>	
        <li>use any forms of obscene language;</li>	
        <li>make statements stirring up to international dissention, containing violence propaganda or offending religious feelings of other Users;</li>	
        <li>send any kind of external links;</li>	
        <li>text messages in capital letters only;</li>	
        <li>repeatedly text the same information or constantly repeat the same phrase;</li>	
        <li>offer to buy or sell the Funds;</li>	
        <li>advertise products or services of other companies or service providers;</li>	
        <li>flood, spam and discuss topics that are not related to Cryptocurrency or GlobeEx;</li>	
        <li>provide false or misleading information about GlobeEx.</li>	
        	
      </ul>
	  <h5>4.6. Inactive Account Fee</h5>
	  <p>In case during 6 (six) calendar months the User has not made a single Transaction, or single Deposit, or single Withdrawal of Funds, the Account of such User shall be considered an Inactive Account (the <b>“Inactive Account”</b>).</p>
	  <p>For all Inactive Accounts, GlobeEx applies a monthly fee, which is the equivalent of 5 (five) US dollars at the current SPOT rate of the US dollar to the Currency in which the fee will be debited (the <b>“Inactive Account Fee”</b>).</p>
	  <p>From the moment of recognizing the Account as Inactive, GlobeEx has the right without notice to the User to debit Inactive Account Fee every calendar month. Inactive Account Fee debit occurs until the 10th (tenth) day of each such month. Herewith, the Account ceases to be considered an Inactive Account from the date of execution of any of the following actions: one Transaction, or one Deposit, or one Withdrawal of Funds. The debiting of Inactive Account Fee shall discontinue from the date when the Account ceases to be considered an Inactive Account. Inactive Account Fee is debited by GlobeEx in any Currency in which the Funds are deposited in the Inactive Account at the time of debit.</p>
	  <p>If the amount of Funds in the User’s Account is less than the amount of Inactive Account Fee, GlobeEx debits the entire balance of Funds from such an Account.</p>
	  <h5>4.6. Inactive Account Fee</h5>
	  <h5 style=" margin-top:5px">5.1. General Provisions</h5>
	  <p>You acknowledge and agree that Transactions you enter into through the Platform will be with GlobeEx where GlobeEx will engage in transactions before, after or simultaneously with your entry of an Order.</p>
	  <p>We will act as principal on our own behalf and not as agent on your behalf. Dealings with you will be carried out by us on an execution-only basis. We will not give you investment advice on any aspect of your trading with us. We are not under any obligation to satisfy ourselves as to the suitability of your trading with us or to monitor or inform you as to the performance of any Order. You trade entirely at your own risk.</p>
	  <p>We will not provide you with any tax advice. You will be responsible at all times for the payment of all taxes due as a result of your trading with us and for providing any relevant tax authority with any information that is requested from you.</p>
	  <p>It is brought to your attention that you may be subject to taxes and costs that are not imposed by us or paid via us. It is your responsibility to ensure the payment of all taxes as they fall due.</p>
	  <p>You recognize that an Order shall only be submitted by you after careful consideration and understand and accept consequences of its execution.</p>
	  <p>GlobeEx applies Fees for the execution of Transactions, which are constantly available in English language at <a  href="https://GlobeEx.io/fees/">https://GlobeEx.io/fees/.</a></p>
	  <p>We shall not accept or execute an Order submitted by you unless your Account contains sufficient Funds to cover the Order that you wish to place and you are not otherwise in breach of this Agreement.</p>
	  <h5>5.2. Trading Mechanics</h5>
	  <p>You may submit an Order online via the Platform. We shall not accept and shall not be under any obligation to execute any Order submitted other than by these means. The Platform will be open for trading 24 hours a day other than in cases of emergency, suspension or for planned maintenance work (the "Trading Hours"). Outside the Trading Hours, the Platform may not be accessed by you, no Orders may be placed and no Transaction will take place.</p>
	  <p>Your Order is registered on the Platform after verifying the availability of the required amount of Funds on your Account. GlobeEx controls the possibility of Users to carry out Transactions and by this reduces the risk of non-execution of the User's obligations under separate Transactions. The Platform does not register the Order if the Account does not have enough Funds for the purposes of executing a particular Transaction.</p>
	  <p>Upon receipt and acceptance of your Order, we shall place in our name an identical order on the Platform ("Our Back to Back Order") with the same Trade ID as your Order.</p>
	  <p>The prices on which you can trade with us will be the prices we obtain on the Platform for the Currency Pair that you wish to trade. In some circumstances, we may in our sole discretion obtain prices from brokers or other crossing networks and multilateral trading facilities that provide prices for relevant Currency Pairs ("Third Party Sources").</p>
	  <p>Our Back to Back Order submitted to the Platform will mirror the Order that we have received from you. Various factors, such as the quantity of your Order and liquidity available in the Currency Pair you wish to trade, might impact whether Our Back to Back Order will be matched or filled in full on the Platform (including the price for which such order might be executed on the Platform). The prices on our Platform are constantly changing and we do not guarantee that the price you see when placing an Order will be the price at which your Transaction will be executed.</p>
	  <p>We cannot guarantee that Our Back to Back Order will be fully matched or filled in full on the Platform. Our ability to complete a Transaction on your Account is dependent on our ability to execute Our Back to Back Order on the Platform or obtain a price and match at Third Party Source. It is only when Our Back to Back Order is fully matched or fully filled on the Platform or will match with a Third Party Sources, that your Order will be executed.</p>
	  <p>You may cancel any part of your Order so long as the corresponding part of Our Back to Back Order that relates to the part of the Order you wish to cancel has not been matched or filled on the Platform or from a Third Party Source. Once Our Back to Back Order has been filled in full then you cannot cancel your Order.</p>
	  <p>Upon Our Back to Back Order being filled in whole or in part on the Platform or matched, this will give rise to a back to back transaction in our name on the Platform ("Our Back to Back Transaction"). Upon Our Back to Back Transaction being confirmed on the Platform, we shall enter this Transaction in your Account at the same price and in the same size as Our Back to Back Transaction.</p>
	  <p>However, if we obtain a price from a Third Party Source, we shall enter into a trade with a third party offering that price (which shall also be a "Back to Back Transaction" for the purposes of this Agreement), and once we have done so, your Order will be executed and entered in your Account at the same price and in the same size as Our Back to Back Transaction.</p>
	  <p>The price of your Order will be the price at which Our Back to Back Transaction has been opened in whole or part on the Platform or with the Third Party Source ("the Opening Price"). Our Back to Back Orders may result in a number of Back to Back Transactions being executed to fill your Order in whole or in part. Where multiple Back to Back Transactions are executed to fill Our Back to Back Order, we will open multiple Orders with you to fill your Order and the Opening Price for each such trade may be different.</p>
	  <p>The price at which your Order transacts will be the price at which the Back to Back Transaction has been closed in whole or part on the Platform, or using a Third Party Source ("the Closing Price"). If Our Back to Back Transaction is closed in tranches you will receive the price that we receive on the Platform or from a Third Party Source for that part of Our Back to Back Transaction that is closed. It may therefore be the case that you receive multiple prices to complete a Transaction.</p>
	  <p>Each Transaction on your Account will be binding on you notwithstanding that by submitting an Order you may have exceeded any limit applicable to your trading with us.</p>
	  <p>Such actions as placing Orders, calling them back and closing the Transactions are reflected in the User’s Personal Cabinet.</p>
	  <p>The information about the closed Transaction is available for all the Users during a period of time determined by GlobeEx.</p>
	 
<h5>6. TYPES OF ORDERS</h5>
<b>•	Simple Buy Order</b>
	 <p>A simple buy Order represents the User’s offer to buy a certain amount of Funds at the Exchange Rate set by the User.</p>
	  <p>To place a simple buy Order the User has to fill the corresponding form in the Personal Cabinet indicating the amount of Funds to buy and setting the Exchange Rate for such purchase.</p>
	  <p>A simple buy Order can be executed at a lower Exchange Rate than the one indicated in the placed Order. Herewith the User will be refunded with the excessively paid part of the commission. A simple buy Order cannot be executed at a higher Exchange Rate than the one indicated in the placed Order.</p>
	  <b>•	Simple Sell Order</b>
	  <p>A simple sell Order represents the User’s offer to sell a certain amount of Funds at the Exchange Rate set by the User.</p>
	  <p>To place a simple sell Order the User has to fill the corresponding form in the Personal Cabinet indicating the amount of Funds to sell and setting the Exchange Rate.</p>
	  <b>•	Market Buy Order</b>
	  <p>A market buy Order represents the User's offer to buy a certain amount of Funds without setting the Exchange Rate.</p>
	  <p>To place a market buy Order the User has to fill the corresponding form in the Personal Cabinet indicating the amount of Funds to buy.</p>
	  <p>The Order will be executed at the lowest Exchange Rate proposed on the Platform.</p>
	  <p>GlobeEx reward for the operation (in accordance with the Fees) will be charged immediately at the moment of Transaction closing.</p>
	  <b>•	Market Sell Order</b>
	  <p>A market sell Order represents the User's offer to sell a certain amount of Funds without setting the Exchange Rate.</p>
	  <p>To place a market sell Order the User has to fill the corresponding form in the Personal Cabinet indicating the amount of Funds to sell.</p>
	  <p>The Order will be executed at the highest Exchange Rate proposed on the Platform.</p>
	  <p>GlobeEx reward for the operation will be charged immediately at the moment of Transaction closing.</p>
	  <b>•	Complex Buy and Sell Order</b>
	  <p>A Complex buy and sell Order represents the User's offer to buy a certain amount of Funds at the Exchange Rate set by the User and to sell the acquired amount of Funds at the Exchange Rate set by the User. So, when the User places a Complex buy and sell Order, the Platform in its turn places firstly a simple buy Order and when it is executed, places a simple sell Order.</p>
	  <p>To place a Complex buy and sell Order the User has to fill the corresponding form in the Personal Cabinet indicating the amount of Funds to buy and setting the Exchange Rate, as well as setting the Exchange Rate to be used during the sale of the acquired Funds.</p>
	  <p>This type of Order is governed by a set of rules elaborated for simple buy Order and simple sell Order with specificities related to Complex buy and sell Order.</p>
	  <b>•	Stop Order</b>
	  <p>Stop Order for Buy (buy stop) – is an Order for purchase of a Cryptocurrency at a specified price or higher, which may be used by the User when the price rises and is expected to continue rising.</p>
	  <p>Stop Order for Sell (sell stop) – is an Order for sale of a Cryptocurrency at a specified price or below, which may be used by the User when the price decreases and is expected to continue decreasing. A Stop Sell Order (sell stop) may be placed at price which is lower than the current market price on the Platform.</p>
	  <p>Stop Orders may be used for either to open a position or to close it. When closing a position, Stop Order is used as a protective order limiting losses (stop loss). A Stop Order for Buy (buy stop) may protect a short position (sales), and a Stop Order for Sell (sell stop) may protect a long position (purchases).</p>
	  <p><b>Slippage Notice.</b> Please note that Stop Orders are not a 100% guarantee of getting the desired points of opening or closing of a position. Slippage may occur when the volatility of the market makes a Stop Order at a specified price impossible to be executed and closed. Thus, the respective Stop Order will be executed at the next best price.</p>
	  <h5>7. PREVENTION OF ILLEGAL SITE AND PLATFORM USE</h5>
	  <p>When accessing or using the Platform and/or the Services, you agree that you will not violate any law, contract, IP rights and/or other third-party right or commit a tort, and that you are solely responsible for your conduct while using our Platform and Services.

	  <h5>8. RISK WARNING AND ACCEPTANCE BY USER</h5>
	  <p>The trading of goods and assets, real or virtual, as well as Cryptocurrencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Such price fluctuations may increase or decrease the value of your assets at any given moment. Any currency - virtual or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.</p>
	  <p>Cryptocurrency trading also has special risks not generally shared with Fiat money and/or goods and/or commodities. Unlike most Fiat money, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Cryptocurrencies are unique type of currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can issue more currency or take corrective measures to protect the value of Cryptocurrencies in case of a crisis.</p>
	  <p>The trading of Cryptocurrencies is often susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in Cryptocurrencies because of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling.</p>
	  <p>There may also be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in this Agreement.</p>
	  <p>In light of the abovementioned, you understand that all the operations with Cryptocurrencies have irreversible character and that Funds acquired during the Transaction can be returned only on the basis of additional specific agreement. You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any Order marked as complete.</p>
	  <p>You acknowledge that you have been informed and that you understand and agree that: none of GlobeEx, the GlobeEx Parties nor any of their respective Third Party Technology Providers shall, directly or indirectly, be responsible for, have any liability or obligation in respect of, or otherwise guarantee, the performance or settlement of any Transaction entered into by you through the Platform, and no GlobeEx Party or Third Party Technology Provider shall have any liability to the User or any other Person for any Transaction executed through the Platform.</p>

Not all deposits can be recovered and dependent on what Cryptocurrency has been mistakenly sent to what address can influence difficulty, time and security risk involved. </p>
