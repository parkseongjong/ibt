<h6>1. Introduction</h6>
      <p>Globeex.io and/or parent company GlobeEX Foundation OU(both companies, jointly and severally, shall be referred to as "us", "we" or "Company") respect the privacy of our users (each, "you" or "User") and are committed to protecting the privacy of Users who access, visit, use or engage with our website or any other online services we provide (collectively: the "Services").</p>
      <p>The Company has prepared this Privacy Policy to outline our practices with respect to collecting, using and disclosing your information when you use the Services.</p>
      <p>We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions. By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Services constitutes your ongoing agreement to the Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>The Privacy Policy is a part of the Terms of Service and is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p>In this Privacy Policy you will read about, among other things:</p>
       <ul>
      <li>What type of information we collect</li>
      <li>How we use the information</li>
      <li>With whom we share the information and for what purpose</li>

<p>“Personal Information” means information that we directly associate with a specific person or entity, which may include without limitations, name, addresses, telephone numbers, email address, payment information, unique device ID (the “UDID”), device location, IP address, Website usage date, etc.</p>
<p>“You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing the Website and which by doing so, accepts this Privacy Policy. Any use of the above terminology or other words in the singular, plural, capitalization are taken as interchangeable and therefore as referring to the same.</p>

 <h6>2. What type of information we collect</h6>
      
      <p>We may collect two types of data and information from our Users.</p>
      <p>The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to you, which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services ("Non-personal Information"). We are not aware of the identity from which the Non-personal Information is collected. Non-personal Information which is collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information about your device (e.g., the device you use, the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the website's domain name from which you linked to the Services, etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of the Services. We may also collect information about your activity on the Services (e.g., clicks, actions, online browsing, etc.).</p>
      <p>The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual ("Personal Information"). Such information may include:</p>
 <ul>
      <li>Account Information: When you sign-up and register to the Services, you will be asked to provide us certain details about yourself. You may register to the Services directly through our website.
  <span style=" padding-left:10px">
o	Registering through our website: When you register to the Services through our website, we may collect from you the following information: full name, email address, phone number, full home address (country, state/province, zip code, city, street, house number), gender, date of birth, ID information (issuing country, number, expiry date, etc.), images of identification documents, images of proof-of-residence (utility bills, bank/credit card statements, government-issued letters), images of yourself (selfie photos), information required for our compliance with regulatory Know Your Customer requirements (e.g., contents of KYC Questionnaire and Service Applicant Declaration Form [estimated amount of intended activity, purpose of buying virtual currency, source of the funds used to buy virtual currency, employment status, profession and job title or position, field of activity of employing company or own business, name of employing company or own business, URL to the website of employing company or own business, signature sample, ultimate beneficiary of purchased virtual currency], etc.), as well as any other information you agreed to share with us.
</span>
</li>
      <li>Voluntarily Provided Information: We may collect information which you provide to us voluntarily. For instance, when you share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services. We may also collect the feedback, suggestions, complaints and reports which you send to us. Please note that we may also collect complaints about you from other Users, which may include your Personal Information.</li>
      <li>Communication Information: We may collect information from your communications with us. For example, when you communicate with us, or respond to communications from us, via email, chat, audio or video calls ("Communications"). We may record and keep all the Communications.</li>
      <li>Device Information: We may collect Personal Information from your device. Such information may include geolocation data, IP address, unique identifiers, as well as other information which relates to your activity through the Services.</li>
     
</ul>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information as long as it remains combined.</p>

<h6>3. How we use the information</h6>
       
      <p>We use and share Personal Information in the manners described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to the purposes listed above, the information we collect, which may include your Personal Information, is used for the following purposes:</p>

      <p>If you wish to raise a complaint on how we have handled your Personal Information, please contact us directly at privacy@Globeex.io</p>
